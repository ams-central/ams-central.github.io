                        <p>Antibiotics are often used not just in humans but also in animals like chickens, pigs, cows, and even fish, not necessarily to treat illness, but to promote faster growth or prevent infections before they occur. However, when antibiotics are overused in animal farming, resistant bacteria can develop in these animals.</p>

                        <div class="challenge-list">
                            <h4>1. Prescription Sharing</h4>
                            <p>This happens when people recommend or give their prescribed antibiotics to friends or family members. Sometimes we leave leftover antibiotics in the fridge and pass them on to someone else, even though that medication was prescribed specifically for us. This is dangerous because what worked for one person might not be appropriate for another.</p>

                            <h4>2. Leaving "Reserve" Medicines</h4>
                            <p>Some people keep leftover antibiotics "just in case" they get sick again in the future. While this might seem like a practical idea, it actually encourages self-medication and improper use, especially if the next illness doesn't require antibiotics at all.</p>

                            <h4>3. Not Finishing Medication</h4>
                            <p>This is when a person stops taking their antibiotics once they feel better, instead of completing the full course. As a result, leftover antibiotics accumulate at home. Studies show that in the Philippines, antibiotics can even be bought from small community stores without a prescription. But remember: antibiotics require a doctor's prescription for a reason they must be taken correctly to be effective and safe.</p>

                            <h4>4. Self medication</h4>
                            <p>It's common for many of us to skip the doctor's visit and just buy medicine on our own, thinking we already know what to take. People self-medicate for many reasons:</p>
